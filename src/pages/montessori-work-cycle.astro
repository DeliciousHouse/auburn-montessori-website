          A peaceful learning environment filled with children is a beautiful sight. It is the culmination of the efforts of every
          individual child, educator, and parent working together for the greater good of the learning community.

          <p>
            On a daily basis, students are provided with uninterrupted time and space to practice their lessons either individually or
            in small groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students are also exposed to experiential learning through prepared indoor and outdoor learning environments. Montessori
            educators are trained to direct the child to grow toward inner discipline and peace through purposeful engagement with
            others and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides traditional academic lessons in math, language, and writing, the Montessori curriculum provides opportunities for
            the child to discover and strengthen skills that educate the senses.

        <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed" style="color: var(--color-neutral-700);">
          Montessori education in the 3-6 year old plane of development is a scientific method designed to develop the foundation for
          learning. Within the prepared environment, the desire to learn is continuously being cultivated by trained Montessori
          educators. Observation of the child's physical, intellectual, emotional, social, psychological, and spiritual development
          helps educators respond appropriately to the needs of the child.
